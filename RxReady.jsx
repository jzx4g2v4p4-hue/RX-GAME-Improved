Your counseling point:", options: ["Take them together for tolerance", "Separate the doses by ~2 hours", "Double the cipro dose", "Stop the antacid forever"], answer: 1, explain: "Di/trivalent cations (Ca, Mg, Al, Fe) chelate fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines, slashing absorption. Separate by 2 h before or 6 h after." },
  { skill: "interact", level: 4, q: "Linezolid is given to a patient on sertraline. The concern is:", options: ["Linezolid has MAOI activity → serotonin syndrome", "Reduced antibiotic effect", "Tendon rupture", "Hyperglycemia"], answer: 0, explain: "Linezolid is a reversible MAOI; combined with an SSRI it can precipitate serotonin syndrome. Flag for the prescriber." },
  { skill: "interact", level: 4, q: "Clopidogrel's antiplatelet effect can be blunted by which acid-reducer?", options: ["Pantoprazole", "Famotidine", "Omeprazole", "Calcium carbonate"], answer: 2, explain: "Omeprazole/esomeprazole inhibit CYP2C19, which activates clopidogrel.

  { skill: "counsel", level: 2, q: "Key counseling for alendronate (a bisphosphonate)?", options: ["Take at bedtime with food", "Take with full glass of water, stay upright 30 min, empty stomach", "Crush and mix in juice", "Take with calcium for absorption"], answer: 1, explain: "Take first thing AM with 6–8 oz plain water, remain upright ≥30 min, nothing else by mouth — prevents esophageal irritation and aids absorption." },
  { skill: "counsel", level: 2, q: "A patient starting metronidazole must avoid:", options: ["Dairy", "Sunlight", "Alcohol", "Grapefruit"], answer: 2, explain: "Alcohol with metronidazole (and tinidazole) causes a disulfiram-like reaction — flushing, nausea, vomiting. Avoid during and ~3 days after." },
  { skill: "counsel", level: 2, q: "Doxycycline counseling should warn about:", options: ["Drowsiness", "Photosensitivity & separating from dairy/antacids", "Weight gain", "Blue urine"], answer: 1, explain: "Tetracyclines cause photosensitivity (use sunscreen) and chelate with calcium/iron/antacids — separate doses. Avoid in pregnancy and children <8." },
  { skill: "counsel", level: 3, q: "The most important diet counseling for a warfarin patient is:", options: ["Eliminate all leafy greens", "Keep vitamin K intake consistent", "Eat extra vitamin K", "Avoid all protein"], answer: 1, explain: "It's about consistency, not avoidance. Sudden swings in vitamin K (leafy greens) shift the INR. Keep intake steady and monitor INR." },
  { skill: "counsel", level: 3, q: "Levothyroxine is best taken:", options: ["With breakfast", "On an empty stomach, separated from calcium/iron", "At bedtime with milk", "With an antacid"], answer: 1, explain: "Take 30–60 min before breakfast on an empty stomach; separate from calcium, iron, and antacids which impair absorption." },

  // ---- ERRORS ----
  { skill: "error", level: 2, q: "A new amoxicillin Rx arrives for a patient whose profile lists a penicillin allergy. You should:", options: ["Fill it — it's a different drug", "Contact the prescriber before filling", "Cut the dose in half", "Counsel and dispense"], answer: 1, explain: "Amoxicillin is a penicillin. With a documented PCN allergy, hold and contact the prescriber — never assume the allergy was overridden." },
  { skill: "error", level: 2, q: "Which way of writing a dose is unsafe and should be clarified?", options: ["0.5 mg", "5 mg", "1.0 mg", "10 mg"], answer: 2, explain: "Trailing zeros ('1.0 mg') can be misread as 10 mg. Never use trailing zeros; always use a leading zero ('0.5 mg' not '.5 mg')." },
  { skill: "error", level: 3, q: "A patient already on lisinopril gets a new Rx for enalapril. This is:", options: ["A normal combination", "Duplicate therapy (two ACE inhibitors)", "A required taper", "A drug-food interaction"], answer: 1, explain: "Both are ACE inhibitors — duplicate therapy raising hyperkalemia/hypotension/angioedema risk. Verify intent with the prescriber." },
  { skill: "error", level: 3, q: "An Rx reads 'methotrexate 2.5 mg, 1 tab PO DAILY' for rheumatoid arthritis. The red flag:", options: ["Dose too low", "RA methotrexate is dosed WEEKLY, not daily", "Wrong route", "Needs refrigeration"], answer: 1, explain: "Oral methotrexate for RA is once-WEEKLY. Daily dosing is a classic fatal error — verify with the prescriber before dispensing." },
  { skill: "error", level: 4, q: "Prescriber wrote 'hydroxyzine' but the chart shows the visit was for hypertension. You suspect a:", options: ["Correct order", "Look-alike/sound-alike mix-up with hydralazine", "Dosing error", "Duplicate"], answer: 1, explain: "Hydroxyzine (antihistamine) vs hydralazine (antihypertensive) is a known LASA pair. The indication doesn't match — confirm the intended drug." },

  // ---- OTC ----
  { skill: "otc", level: 1, q: "A pregnant patient asks for something for a headache. Best OTC choice:", options: ["Ibuprofen", "Aspirin", "Acetaminophen", "Naproxen"], answer: 2, explain: "Acetaminophen is generally preferred in pregnancy; NSAIDs (esp. 3rd trimester) and aspirin are avoided. Persistent symptoms → refer." },
  { skill: "otc", level: 2, q: "Why avoid aspirin for a child's fever?", options: ["It tastes bad", "Risk of Reye's syndrome", "It's not strong enough", "It stains teeth"], answer: 1, explain: "Aspirin in children/teens with viral illness is linked to Reye's syndrome. Use acetaminophen or age-appropriate ibuprofen instead." },
  { skill: "otc", level: 2, q: "A patient with hypertension wants a decongestant. The safer suggestion:", options: ["Pseudoephedrine", "Phenylephrine at double dose", "Saline spray / refer", "Any decongestant is fine"], answer: 2, explain: "Oral decongestants (pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine) can raise blood pressure. Suggest saline/intranasal options or refer for hypertensives." },
  { skill: "otc", level: 3, q: "An older adult wants diphenhydramine nightly to sleep. Best response:", options: ["Recommend it freely", "Caution — anticholinergic risks in elderly (Beers); suggest alternatives", "Double the dose", "Combine with melatonin and ignore risks"], answer: 1, explain: "Diphenhydramine is on the Beers list — anticholinergic effects (confusion, falls, urinary retention) are riskier in older adults. Suggest safer options or referral." },
  { skill: "otc", level: 3, q: "A patient has diarrhea with bloody stools and fever. Loperamide is:", options: ["Recommended at high dose", "Not appropriate — refer for evaluation", "Fine with food", "Best combined with antibiotics OTC"], answer: 1, explain: "Bloody diarrhea + fever suggests an invasive/infectious cause. Antimotility agents can be harmful — refer rather than self-treat." },
  { skill: "otc", level: 1, q: "For occasional, infrequent heartburn, the fastest-acting OTC class is:", options: ["Proton pump inhibitor", "Antacid", "H2 blocker", "Antibiotic"], answer: 1, explain: "Antacids neutralize acid for fast, short relief. H2 blockers are slower but last longer; PPIs are for frequent (≥2x/week) heartburn." },
